This Repository refers to the Homeworks of the course Data Management (DM) at University Sapienza of Rome 2022/2023.

## Abstract
Condensed in this repo are the 3 homeworks done during the course. 
In the first one, the goal was to build a football world data management system and test its operation by querying it with 10 queries.  In the second homework, the goal was to try to optimize the previously created schema and do the same with 4 queries chosen from the previous 10. In the last homework, on the other hand, the goal was to recreate the same schema, in NOSQL version on NEo4j.  


## Dataset
